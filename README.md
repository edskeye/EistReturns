# EistReturns
Arcade-puzzle game

I had written this game back in 1992 for 8-bit Atari computers, 
and then given it the 2nd life a year ago on [Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.nwg.dev.eist).
This project is my sandbox to learn some JavaFX. Come and join if you liked some of the previous 
versions.

Although I'm still working on some new features, as e.g. the level editor, 
the game should be fully playable, and not buggy too much.

Installation
===============

**Windows**

Download [eist-returns.exe](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/EistReturns/raw/master/windows/eist-returns.exe) file,
move anywhere, double click to run. If your computer has no Java Runtime Environment installed, 
youâ€™ll be asked to download and install it from Oracle.

**Arch / Arch-based Linux**

Download the latest package from the [arch directory](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/EistReturns/tree/master/arch)

Open Terminal, navigate to Downloads folder and install:

`sudo pacman -U eist-returns-0.0.x-x-x86_64.pkg.tar`

Replace `0.0.x.x` with corresponding numbers from the file you've just downloaded.

The game was tested with vanilla Arch, Antergos and Manjaro Linux.
