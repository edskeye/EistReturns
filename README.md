# EistReturns
Arcade-puzzle game

I had written this game back in 1992 for 8-bit Atari computers, 
and then given it the 2nd life a year ago on [Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.nwg.dev.eist).
This project is my sandbox to learn some JavaFX, and is still under development. Come and join if
you liked some of the previous versions.
