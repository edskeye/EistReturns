# EistReturns
Arcade-puzzle game

I had written this game back in 1992 for 8-bit Atari computers, 
and then given it the 2nd life a year ago on [Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.nwg.dev.eist).
This project is my sandbox to learn some JavaFX. Come and join if you liked some of the previous 
versions.

Although I'm still working on some new features, as e.g. the level editor, 
the game should be fully playable, and not buggy too much.

To **launch the level editor**, add the `-E` or `--edit` argument to the command line.

Installation
===============

**Arch / Arch-based Linux**

Please install the **eist-returns** package from the AUR. Also the PKGBUILD file in the 
[arch](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/EistReturns/tree/master/arch) directory is always up to date. 
Two separate shortcuts will be created: `Eist returns` for the game, and `Eist Editor` for the Level Editor.

To launch from the command, line just type `eist-returns` for the game, and `eist-returns - E | --edit` for the editor.

**Windows**

Download [eist-returns.exe](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/EistReturns/raw/master/windows/eist-returns.exe) file,
move anywhere, double click to run. If your computer has no Java Runtime Environment installed, 
youâ€™ll be asked to download and install it from Oracle.
